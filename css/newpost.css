<a href="http://www.bradwalsh.com" title="Brad Walsh">Brad Walsh</a> is super fucking cool. Repeat after me, Brad Walsh - is super fucking cool. 
He came out to Hollywood a couple of weeks ago for the Golden Globes. Luckily we got a chance to meet up that Saturday night, take some photos, drink, talk remixes, and laugh at Kathy Griffin. On my way to meet up with Brad and his boyfriend Christian, Brad casually mentioned his friend Ollie would be joining us as well. At the time he mentioned this I thought nothing of it. Halfway crosstown on my way to their hotel? Well that's a different story. I finally made the connection that Brad's friend "Ollie" was none other than the Olivia Stone from <a href="http://www.theoohlas.com" title="the oohlas">The Oohlas</a>. Buckle up, it's time to get excited. 

For being one of the worst movies I've ever seen, Spiderman 3 has an amazing soundtrack. The lineup features everyone from the Flaming Lips and Rogue Wave to Jet and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. This surprisingly awesome compilation ended with a song called Small Parts, by a band from L.A called the Oohlas. I used to have that song on a summertime mix...so it brings back NOTHING but wonderful memories. Damn that Pavlov. Needless to say I was glad I brought my camera and was able to snag some shots of Brad and Ollie (pictured above...obvi). I'm not going to go into details and brag about how awesome hanging out with Brad and Ollie was. It wouldn't be fair to you. I'm sure your Saturday was awesome too. Now... onto the music info. Widely considered to be the meat of my act. 

Now we all know that even if the movie is really good - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/" title="One of the greatest movies ever...still, the book was better"> the book is always better.</a> Kind of like books and movies, but in reverse - <a href="http://www.bradwalsh.com/music/" title="Brad Walsh's Music">Brad Walsh's remixes</a>...are always way better than the original songs. I can't even listen Britney's version of Womanizer of Kanye's version of Love Lockdown anymore. They can consider themselves officially eclipsed. All you really need to know about Brad's music is I that have a list that hangs on my wall. 
It's titled "Ways I'll know that I'm super famous." 
#17 on that list is "Getting Knighted." 
#16 is "Getting one of my songs remixed by Brad Walsh." You do the math. 
Next subject.

Olivia "Ollie" Stone. Upon meeting Ms.Stone I had to inquire about her bands upcoming album Chinchila. I had thought it was coming out in December (I probably made that up) but hadn't heard anything in a little while. She gave me the skinny that their album Chinchilla is coming out in a couple of days...but since this was a couple of weeks ago and I'm wicked freaking impatient + super demanding, she agreed to send me a couple of tracks to preview. Holy fuck I am so glad she did. Since I've gotten my hands on the EP it's been on constant rotation. I expected to enjoy it. I didn't expect it to become my latest addiction. I'd say more, but I'm going to dedicate a whole post to how awesome this album is once I get my hands on it. So for now, just listen to this song Adventures. It makes me want to go on actual adventures. As a matter of fact, this song inspired me to break into a hotel last weekend. True story.
