        &quot;The process of making art for me has always been more like taking a bath than a shower.
        Rather than a cleansing outward expression, my work tends to be the product of stewing in my own mental debris.&quot;

      Los Angeles based artist Will Deutsch was raised in Orange County and
      studied fine arts at UCLA. His works, which range in medium from paint to
      paper to plastic, explore themes of trauma, addiction, and heart break as
      institutionalized by pop culture.  He currently works from a small studio
      in his house attempting to create things as beautiful as himself and the
      people around him.
