        &quot;The process of making art for me has always been more like taking a bath than a shower.
        Rather than a cleansing outward expression, my work tends to be the product of stewing in my own mental debris.&quot;

      Los Angeles based artist Will Deutsch was raised in Orange County and studied fine arts at UCLA. His works, which range
      in medium from paint to paper to plastic, explore themes of trauma, addiction, and heart break as institutionalized by pop culture.
      He currently works from a small studio in his house attempting to create things as beautiful as himself and the people around him.
